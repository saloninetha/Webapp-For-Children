          <p>Neha and Naveen were siblings who lived in a town. They were both 8 years old and studied in the same school. They liked to play games and watch cartoons, but they also had a fear of a man who lived in their neighbourhood. He was a middle-aged man who often tried to lure them with chocolates and toys, and touch them inappropriately. He also threatened them to keep quiet, or else he would harm them and their family.<br>
            <br>They decided to tell their parents and teacher about the man, and seek their help. Their parents and teacher were shocked and angry. They told them that they had done the right thing, and that they had the right to be safe from any kind of sexual abuse. They explained to them that the POCSO Act, 2012 was a law that protected children from offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography, while safeguarding the interest of the child at every stage of the judicial process.<br>
            <br>Their parents and teacher then filed a complaint against the man in the police station, under the POCSO Act, 2012. The police registered the complaint, and gave them a copy of it. They also took Neha and Naveen to a special court, where they met a friendly judge and a lawyer. They recorded their statement in a child-friendly manner, and asked them some questions. They also provided them with medical care, counselling, and support.<br>
            <br>The judge then heard the case, and examined the evidence and witnesses. He found that the man was guilty of sexually abusing Neha and Naveen, and violating the POCSO Act, 2012. He sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment and fine. He also ordered him to pay compensation to Neha and Naveen, and to undergo rehabilitation.<br>
            <br>Neha and Naveen were happy and relieved. They thanked their parents, teacher, police, judge, and lawyer for their help and support. They also learned a lot about the POCSO Act, 2012, and decided to share their knowledge with their friends and classmates. They also decided to grow up to be brave and responsible citizens, and help other children who were in need of help.</p>
