            Raj was a 15 year old boy who lived in a slum with his mother and younger sister.His father had died in an accident and his mother worked as a maid in a nearby apartment.Raj had to drop out of school to help his mother with the household expenses.He often roamed around the streets with his friends, who were also poor and uneducated.One day, Raj and his friends decided to steal a bike from a parking lot. They thought it would be fun and easy to sell the bike and get some money.They did not realize that the bike belonged to a police officer and a CCTV camera installed in the parking lot captured their faces and the number plate of the bike. <br>
            The next day, the police traced the bike and arrested Raj and his friends.They were taken to the police station and beaten up by the officers.They were scared and confused. They did not know what would happen to them. They thought they would be sent to jail and treated like criminals. However, they were lucky.The police officer who owned the bike was a kind and honest man.He knew that Raj and his friends were not bad boys, but victims of poverty and ignorance. He also knew that the law had changed and that children who committed crimes had to be treated differently from adults. <br>
            He told the other officers to stop beating them and to take them to a special court called the Juvenile Justice Board. The Juvenile Justice Board was a place where children who were in conflict with the law were given a fair chance to reform and rehabilitate themselves.The board consisted of a magistrate and two social workers who were trained and experienced in dealing with children. They listened to Raj and his friends and understood their problems and circumstances. They did not punish them harshly, but gave them a warning and a counseling session. <br>
            They also ordered them to attend a special school where they would get education, vocational training and moral guidance.They told them that they had the right to a dignified and productive life and that they should not waste it by doing wrong things. Raj and his friends were relieved and grateful. They realized their mistake and decided to change their ways.They thanked the police officer and the board members for giving them a second chance. They joined the special school and started learning new things.<br>
            They also made new friends who were positive and supportive. They felt hopeful and happy. They decided to follow the law and to respect the rights of others.They also decided to help other children who were in similar situations.They became responsible and confident citizens.</p>
