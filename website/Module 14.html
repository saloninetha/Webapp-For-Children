          <p>Anil and Anjali were twins who lived in a city. They were both born with hearing impairment, which means that they could not hear properly. They used sign language to communicate with each other and their parents, who were also hearing impaired.<br>
            <br>They went to a special school, where they learned to read and write, and also received vocational training. They also participated in various cultural and sports activities, and won many prizes and awards. They were happy and confident, and had many friends.<br>
            <br>One day, they decided to apply for a job in a bank, where they had done their internship. They had performed well during their internship, and had impressed their seniors and colleagues. They filled the online application form, and submitted their resume and certificates.<br>
            <br>However, they received a rejection letter from the bank, which said that they were not eligible for the job because of their disability. The letter said that the bank did not have any provision for hiring persons with disabilities, and that they would not be able to perform the duties of the job.<br>
            <br>Anil and Anjali were shocked and hurt. They felt that they had been discriminated against and denied their right to employment. They decided to fight for their rights, and approached a lawyer, who was also a person with disability. The lawyer told them that they had the right to equal opportunities, protection of rights and full participation, as per the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995.<br>
            <br>The lawyer explained to them that the Act was a law that aimed to empower persons with disabilities and ensure their welfare and development. He also told them that the Act provided for various benefits and facilities for persons with disabilities, such as:<br>
            - Reservation of 3% of vacancies in government posts and public sector undertakings.
            - Relaxation of age limit and fee concession for admission to educational institutions.
            - Provision of aids and appliances, scholarships, and special education.
            - Establishment of special employment exchanges, vocational rehabilitation centres, and district disability welfare officers.
            - Constitution of central and state coordination committees and executive committees to monitor and implement the Act.
            - Appointment of chief commissioner and commissioners for persons with disabilities to redress the grievances and safeguard the rights of persons with disabilities.<br>
            <br>The lawyer then filed a case against the bank in the court of the commissioner for persons with disabilities, who was the authority to deal with such matters. The lawyer argued that the bank had violated the Act by rejecting Anil and Anjali's application on the basis of their disability, and that they deserved to be given a fair chance to prove their abilities and skills.<br>
            <br>The bank's lawyer defended the bank's decision, and said that the bank had followed the rules and regulations, and that the job required good communication and interpersonal skills, which Anil and Anjali lacked due to their disability. He also said that the bank did not have any facilities or equipment to accommodate persons with disabilities, and that it would be difficult and costly to provide them.<br>
            <br>The commissioner heard both the sides, and examined the evidence and documents. He found that Anil and Anjali had met all the qualifications and criteria for the job, and that they had performed well during their internship. He also found that the bank had not made any efforts to provide reasonable accommodation or assistive devices for persons with disabilities, and that it had discriminated against Anil and Anjali on the ground of their disability.<br>
            <br>The commissioner then passed an order in favour of Anil and Anjali, and directed the bank to reconsider their application and offer them the job. He also directed the bank to provide them with suitable facilities and equipment, such as hearing aids, sign language interpreters, and captioned phones. He also imposed a fine on the bank for violating the Act, and warned it to refrain from such practices in the future.<br>
            <br>Anil and Anjali were happy and relieved. They thanked the lawyer and the commissioner for their help and support. They joined the bank, and worked hard and sincerely. They proved their worth and potential, and earned the respect and appreciation of their colleagues and customers. They decided to grow up to be good citizens and help other persons with disabilities who were in need of help.</p>
