          <p> Anjali and Arjun were siblings who lived in an orphanage in Delhi. They had lost their parents in a car accident and had no relatives to take care of them. They were sad and lonely, but they had each other.
            The orphanage was run by a cruel woman named Mrs. Sharma, who did not care about the children at all. She made them work hard, gave them little food, and beat them if they disobeyed her. She did not provide them with proper education, health care, or recreation. She also took money from the government and donors, but did not spend it on the children.
            One day, a team of social workers came to the orphanage to inspect it. They had received a complaint from a neighbour who had seen Mrs. Sharma mistreating the children. They asked Mrs. Sharma to show them the license for running the orphanage. Mrs. Sharma said that she had a license, but she could not find it. She tried to bribe the social workers, but they refused.
            The social workers then talked to the children and found out the truth about the orphanage. They learned that Mrs. Sharma had never applied for a license under the Women's and Children's Institutions (Licensing) Act, 1956, which was a law that required all institutions for women and children to have a license and follow certain standards and conditions. The social workers told the children that they had the right to live in a safe and healthy environment and have access to quality care and services.
            The social workers then took Mrs. Sharma to the police station and rescued the children from the orphanage. They arranged for the children to be shifted to a licensed and well-managed institution, where they would get proper education, health care, and recreation. They also helped the children to find new families who would adopt them and love them.
            Anjali and Arjun were among the lucky ones who found a new home. They were adopted by a kind couple who had no children of their own. They were happy and grateful to the social workers who had saved them from Mrs. Sharma and taught them about the Women's and Children's Institutions (Licensing) Act, 1956. They decided to grow up to be good citizens and help other children who were in need.</p>
