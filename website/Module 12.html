          <p>Priya and Pankaj were siblings who lived in a village in Rajasthan. They had a happy and simple life with their parents, who were farmers. They went to school, played with their friends, and helped their parents with the chores.<br>
            <br>One day, a man came to their village and offered them a job in a big city. He said that he would pay them well and take care of them. He said that they would work in a hotel, where they would serve food and drinks to the guests. He said that it was a great opportunity for them to see the world and earn money.<br>
            <br>Priya and Pankaj were tempted by the man's offer, and asked their parents for permission. Their parents were reluctant, but they agreed, thinking that it would be good for their children's future. They trusted the man, who seemed nice and friendly. They packed their bags and said goodbye to their parents and friends.<br>
            <br>The man took them to the city, but instead of taking them to a hotel, he took them to a brothel, where he sold them to a woman, who was the owner of the brothel. The woman told them that they had to work as prostitutes, and that they had no choice. She said that they had to please the customers, who would pay money for having sex with them. She said that if they refused or tried to escape, they would be beaten and tortured.<br>
            <br>Priya and Pankaj were shocked and scared. They realized that they had been cheated and trapped by the man, who was a trafficker. They cried and begged the woman to let them go, but she did not listen. She locked them in a room, where they had to face the horrors of sexual exploitation and abuse.<br>
            <br>One day, a team of police officers came to the brothel and raided it. They had received a tip-off from a social worker, who had seen the children working there. They asked the woman to show them the license for running the brothel. The woman said that she had a license, but she could not produce it. She tried to bribe the police officers, but they refused.<br>
            <br>The police officers then rescued Priya, Pankaj, and all the other children and women from the brothel. They told them that they had the right to live with dignity and freedom, and that no one could exploit them for sexual purposes. They explained to them that the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 was a law that prevented the trafficking of persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation. They also told them that the law made the trafficking and sexual exploitation of persons a criminal offence, and that the traffickers and brothel owners would be punished for it.<br>
            <br>The police officers then took Priya, Pankaj, and all the other rescued persons to a shelter home, where they received medical care, food, clothing, and counselling. They also enrolled them in a special school, where they learned to read and write, and also received vocational training. They also helped them to get identity cards, bank accounts, and other benefits from the government schemes.<br>
            <br>Priya and Pankaj were happy to be free from the brothel and the traffickers. They were grateful to the police officers and the social worker who had saved them and taught them about the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956. They decided to grow up to be good citizens and help other people who were in similar situations.</p>
