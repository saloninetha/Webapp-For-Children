          <p class="head">Quest for Freedom from Child Marriage</p>
        
          <p>Reena and Raju were friends who lived in a village in Uttar Pradesh. They were both 12 years old and studied in the same school. They liked to play games and read books, but they also had a fear of getting married at a young age.<br>
            <br>Their parents had arranged their marriages with older partners, who were strangers to them. They had no say in the matter, and they had to obey their parents and elders. They knew that child marriage was a harmful practice, that could affect their health, education, and future.<br>
            <br>One day, they learned about a law called the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 from their teacher. The teacher told them that it was a law that fixed the age of marriage for girls at 14 years and boys at 18 years. He also told them that it was popularly known as the Sharda Act, after its sponsor, Harbilas Sarda. He explained to them that the law was passed to prevent the evil of child marriage, and to protect the rights and interests of children.<br>
            <br>Reena and Raju were surprised and happy to hear about the law. They decided to use it to stop their marriages, and to continue their studies. They gathered courage and told their parents about the law, and asked them to cancel their marriages. They also sought the help of their teacher, who supported them and talked to their parents.<br>
            <br>Their parents were initially angry and reluctant, but they eventually agreed to respect their wishes and the law. They realized that child marriage was a crime, and that they could be punished for it. They also realized that Reena and Raju deserved to have a better life, and to choose their own partners when they grew up.<br>
            <br>Reena and Raju were relieved and grateful to their teacher and the law. They decided to study hard and pursue their dreams. They also decided to spread awareness about the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 and the harms of child marriage to other children and parents in their village.</p>
