          <p class="highlight">Raj and Rani were twins who lived in a slum in Mumbai. They had to work in a factory that made firecrackers, along with many other children. They worked for long hours, in dangerous conditions, and for very low wages. They often got injured by the chemicals and explosives, and suffered from breathing problems and skin infections. They had no time or opportunity to go to school or play.<br><br>
            
            One day, a team of labour inspectors came to the factory and raided it. They had received a tip-off from a social activist who had seen the children working there. They asked the factory owner to show them the license for employing children. The factory owner said that he had a license, but he could not produce it. He tried to bribe the labour inspectors, but they refused.<br><br>
            
            The labour inspectors then rescued the children from the factory and took them to a shelter home. They told them that they had the right to education, health, and leisure, and that no one could exploit them by making them work in hazardous occupations and processes. They explained to them that the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 was a law that banned the employment of children below 14 years in certain occupations and processes, and regulated their conditions of work in others. They also told them that the law provided for penalties for those who violated it, and for the welfare of the rescued children.<br><br>
            
            Raj and Rani were happy to be free from the factory and the factory owner. They were enrolled in a special school, where they learned to read and write, and also received vocational training. They also made new friends and enjoyed playing games and sports. They decided to grow up to be responsible citizens and help other children who were in similar situations.</p>
