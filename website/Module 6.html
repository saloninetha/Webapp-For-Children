          <p>Manoj and Meena were siblings who lived in a village in Bihar. Their father had taken a loan from a landlord to pay for their mother's medical treatment, but he could not repay it. The landlord forced their father to work in his fields as a bonded labourer, and also took Manoj and Meena as his servants. They had to work from dawn to dusk, without any rest, food, or education. They were beaten and abused by the landlord and his men.
          One day, a team of government officials came to the village and conducted a survey. They had received a report from a human rights organization that there were many cases of bonded labour in the area. They asked the villagers about their living and working conditions, and identified the bonded labourers and their families. They also asked the landlord to show them the documents of the loans and the agreements he had made with the labourers.

They explained to him that the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 was a law that abolished the system of bonded labour in India, and freed all the bonded labourers from their debts and bondage. They also told him that the law made the practice of bonded labour a criminal offence, and that he would be punished for it.
            The officials then rescued Manoj, Meena, their father, and all the other bonded labourers from the landlord. They took them to a rehabilitation centre, where they received medical care, food, clothing, and counselling. They also enrolled them in a special school, where they learned to read and write, and also received vocational training. They also helped them to get identity cards, bank accounts, and other benefits from the government schemes.
            Manoj and Meena were happy to be free from the landlord and his tyranny. They were grateful to the officials and the human rights organization who had saved them and taught them about the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976. They decided to grow up to be good citizens and help other people who were in similar situati
