        <p>  Riya was a 10-year-old girl who lived in a slum with her parents and two younger brothers. Her father worked as a daily wage labourer and her mother was a domestic helper. They barely had enough money to buy food and clothes, let alone pay for Riya's school fees. Riya had to drop out of school after class 3 and help her mother with household chores and taking care of her brothers.
Riya loved to study and dreamed of becoming a doctor someday. She often borrowed books from her neighbour, who was a teacher, and read them in her spare time. She also liked to watch educational programmes on TV whenever she got a chance. She was curious about the world and wanted to learn more.
One day, she saw an advertisement on TV about a free health camp organised by a local NGO. The ad said that children could get free check-ups, vaccinations, medicines, and health education at the camp. Riya was excited and asked her mother if she could go. Her mother agreed, thinking that it would be good for Riya's health.
The next day, Riya went to the camp with her neighbour. There, she met a friendly doctor who examined her and gave her some medicines and vitamins. She also met a nurse who taught her about hygiene, nutrition, and disease prevention. She learned how to wash her hands properly, how to brush her teeth, how to eat a balanced diet, and how to protect herself from common illnesses. She also learned that she had the right to health and health care, and that it was part of her fundamental right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
Riya was amazed and happy to learn so many new things. She thanked the doctor and the nurse for their help and kindness. She also asked them if they could help her go back to school. They told her that they would try to find a way to enrol her in a nearby government school, where she could get free education under the Right to Education Act. They also gave her some books and stationery to encourage her to study.
Riya felt hopeful and grateful. She realised that she had the potential to achieve her dreams, and that she deserved to have a healthy and happy life. She decided to share what she learned with her family and friends, and to inspire them to claim their rights as well. She also vowed to work hard and become a doctor someday, so that she could help other children like her.
            Manoj and Meena were happy to be free from the landlord and his tyranny. They were grateful to the officials and the human rights organization who had saved them and taught them about the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976. They decided to grow up to be good citizens and help other people who were in similar situations.</p>
